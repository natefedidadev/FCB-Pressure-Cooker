    "**Camera tracking limitation:** Players come in and out of frame throughout the match. The tracking software can’t maintain consistent position data when players go off-screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identity fragmentation:** Metrica prioritised consistency over identity continuity. When a player re-enters frame, they may get a new tracking ID. This inflates player ID counts by 40–60 per match.\n",
    "\n",
    "**No player identity mapping:** Tracking data uses numeric IDs with no link to player names or jersey numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partial recovery:** We built a custom batch parser (`tracking_batch_parser.py`) that extracts usable ball positions and partial player positions from the raw ATD feed across all 11 matches. The parser produces `player_positions.csv`, `ball_positions.csv`, and `team_map.json` per match. This recovered data is used for spatial features (team shape, ball proximity, overload detection) in danger moment explanations, but it is not reliable enough for full defensive shape or compactness analysis."
