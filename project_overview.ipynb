    "**Video time vs in-game time:** The timestamps in the Player Tracking Data and Smart Tagging Data match up with the video time, but do not match up with the in-game timer. This is because the in-game timer does not match up with the video time. This causes an offset with when tags occur in the XML files and when they occur in the in-game timer, making the tag times not line up with the in-game times.\n",

    "**Example:** The in-game timer will start at 15:32 in the video, causing an initial 15:32 offset in time within the data.\n",

    "- After the game ends\n",

    "**Manual calibration:** Manually record the start time of the game in the video, the start of the halftime interval, the end of the halftime interval, and the end time of the game. Use those times to offset all events in the player tracking and smart tagging data if you want it to match up to the in-game timer rather than the video."

The pipeline runs a continuous defensive risk score over match time, detects fault-line moments (risk peaks linked to goals conceded), and uses an LLM to generate coach-friendly tactical explanations, all surfaced through an interactive dashboard with video seek."

Users would be asked to input the 4 offset times for a match video. This would allow for smart tags to line up with the in-game timer, making analysis more intuitive and easy to understand.\n\n**Player ID Merging:** Metrica Nexus could give users the option to merge player_ids in the player tracking data and connect the player_ids to existing player names or player stats in a database.\n\n**Player Recognition Confidence:** Metrica Nexus could also improve their player recognition software to include confidence values for correlating different player_ids to each other.",
